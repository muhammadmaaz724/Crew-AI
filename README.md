# CrewAI Learning Journey

This repository documents my step-by-step progress, experiments, and projects as I learn and work with agentic AI using [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI).

## About
This repository contains:
- Hands-on CrewAI projects built during the learning process.
- Notes, examples, and best practices discovered along the way.
- Experiments with multi-agent systems, tools, and workflows.
- Integration tests with different LLMs such as ChatGPT, Claude, and open-source models.

The purpose of this repository is both personal learning and providing reference material for others exploring CrewAI.
